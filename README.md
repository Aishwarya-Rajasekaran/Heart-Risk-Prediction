# Heart-Risk-Prediction

This project aids the physicians in predicting the medical condition that the
patient is suffering from using data mining. It is a powerful tool for evidence based
medicine. It is fed with various cardiac parameters and the corresponding medical
conditions associated with them

The outcomes which would prove useful to the physicians that need to be
predicted are listed below.
1. Chances of right heart failure (post transplant)
2. Chance of survival until heart transplant
3. Chances of hospitalization
4. Chances of post operation severe infection
5. Chances of rejection

Based on the result, the patient and their next of kin can be counselled by the
physician on a suitable course of action â€“ be it medical surgical or otherwise. This also
has an added advantage of preparing them for the worst case scenario both
psychologically and financially. Another major advantage of this project is the
immediate implementation on the clinical side. There is negligible lag time between
bench to bedside application.
